# **Technology Used and Credits**

I used many useful references in completing this project including the following.  In particular, I found the layout of the w3schools reference materials to be extremely intuitive and helpful.  They even have a "try me" feature where elements of code can be reviewed and tested. 

- [W3Schools - HTML Code reference:](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)
- [W3Schools - CSS Code reference:](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp)


# **Learnings**

[ADD SPECIFICS HERE]

Lastly, though intuitive and a lesson I have learned throughout my career, collaborating with fellow bootcamp students is very rewarding.  I was able to see different viewpoints and approaches to understanding the concepts of this project.  Additionally, I was exposed to several short cuts and tricks when using VS code.   

# **About the Author**

My name is Brad Coleman. I am fairly new to web development but have considered it a hobby for several years and have hacked my way through learning various aspects including php, html and mysql.  I am currently enrolled in the Cal Berkeley Extension Web Development Boot camp and am excited to learn web development more holistically.  I have spent my earlier career working as a corporate controller / CPA.
